# Drupal10 Portfolio

This is a final project for a Drupal course at Business College Helsinki. The goal was to build an example portfolio page using Drupal. This project has traditional Drupal hierarchy. It is Drupal 10, a theme, some modules and custom CSS.

The theme I worked with is called [Power Portolio](https://www.drupal.org/project/power_portfolio). I placed it in a custom folder, modified and added some files to better fit my purposes.

I installed 2 modules, 'Resposive images' (To help make the project images responsive for better mobile viewing. A breakpoints.yml file was needed as well) and ['Go back'](https://www.drupal.org/project/go_back), which let's you place a button that takes the user to the previous page.

The front page includes a tech stack/skills section. I set the 'front page' view to show the 'tech' content type on a reponsive grid, having the teaser be just the image. The projects page is a view of the 'project' content type that displays the teasers in a resposive grid as well. The projects have taxonomy terms with their techs, that can be filtered.
