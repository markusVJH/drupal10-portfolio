# Drupal10 Portfolio

This is a final project for a Drupal course at Business College Helsinki. The goal was to build a portfolio page using Drupal. This project has a traditional Drupal hierarchy. It is Drupal 10, a theme, some modules and custom CSS.

The theme I worked with is called [Power Portolio](https://www.drupal.org/project/power_portfolio). I placed it in a custom folder, and modified and added some files to better fit my purposes.

I installed 2 modules, 'Resposive images' (This is a core module. I enabled this module, and made a 'breakpoints.yml' file to help make the project page images responsive for better mobile viweing.) and ['Go back'](https://www.drupal.org/project/go_back), which let's you place a button that takes the user to the previous page.
